# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
2. Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array(
3. Using the np.linalg.lu(), we get two results (first is L and second is
 U) of the given matrix.
4. Using the np.linalg.lu_factor() and np.linalg.lu_solve(), we get the solution
5.  End the program

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
```

## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
